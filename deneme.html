				<summary>Oh Captain My Captain</summary><p>o captain! my captain! our fearful trip is done,<br/>
the ship has weathered every rack, the prize we sought is won,<br/>
the port is near, the bells i hear, the people all exulting,<br/>
while follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring;<br/>
but o heart! heart! heart!<br/>
o the bleeding drops of red, <br/>
where on the deck my captain lies,<br/>
fallen cold and dead.</p>

<p>o captain! my captain! rise up and hear the bells;<br/>
rise up--for you the flag is flung--for you the bugle trills,<br/>
for you bouquets and ribboned wreaths--for you the shores accrowding,<br/>
for you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning;<br/>
here captain! dear father!<br/>
this arm beneath your head!<br/>
it is some dream that on the deck<br/>
you've fallen cold and dead.</p>

<p>my captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still,<br/>
my father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will,<br/>
the ship is anchored safe and sound, its voyage closed and done,<br/>
from fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won;<br/>
exult o shores, and ring o bells!<br/>
but i, with mournful tread,<br/>
walk the deck my captain lies,<br/>
fallen cold and dead.
</p>- Walt Whitman </details>
<details><summary>Mein Bruder war ein Flieger</summary>
<p>My brother was a pilot<br/>
His papers came one day<br/>
He got his kit together<br/>
And took a southward way</p>

<p>My brother is a conqueror<br/>
Our people need more space<br/>
And winning territory by war’s<br/>
An old dream of our race</p>

<p>The space in the Spanish mountains<br/>
My brother got to keep<br/>
Measures just six feet in length<br/>
And is five foot deep.</p>
- Bertolt Brecht</details>
<details><summary>After the Battle</summary>
<p>My father, hero of benignant mien,<br/>
On horseback visited the gory scene,<br/>
After the battle as the evening fell,<br/>
And took with him a trooper loved right well,<br/>
Because of bravery and presence bold.<br/>
The field was covered with the dead, all cold,<br/>
And shades of night were deepening : came a sound,<br/>
Feeble and hoarse, from something on the ground ;<br/>
It was a Spaniard of the vanquished force,<br/>
Who dragged himself with pain beside their course.<br/>
Wounded and bleeding, livid and half dead,<br/>
"Give me to drink — in pity, drink!" he said.<br/>
My father, touched, stretched to his follower now<br/>
A flask of rum that from his saddle-bow<br/>
Hung down : "The poor soul — give him drink," said he<br/>
But while the trooper prompt, obediently<br/>
Stooped towards the other, he of Moorish race<br/>
Pointed a pistol at my father's face,<br/>
And with a savage oath the trigger drew :<br/>
The hat flew off, a bullet passing through.<br/>
As swerved his charger in a backward stride,<br/>
"Give him to drink the same," my father cried.</p>
- Victor Hugo
